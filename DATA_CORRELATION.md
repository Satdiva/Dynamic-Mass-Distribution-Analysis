# Forensic Data Correlation: Model Validation Points

This document provides a list of empirical anomalies that reconcile with a **45-km (28-mile) Shell-Stratified Mass Distribution**. Users are encouraged to cross-reference these points with public seismic and gravitational datasets.

## 1. The Greenland Gravity Gradient (1989)
**Observation:** Borehole measurements at the DYE-3 site in Greenland revealed that gravity decreased by approximately **0.3% more** than predicted by the standard solid-earth model as depth increased.
**PIOSA Validation:** This "faster-than-expected" decrease is a direct prediction of the **Shell Theorem**. In a 45-km hull model, the sensor rapidly loses the mass contribution of the crust above it, moving toward the internal null-gravity cavity.



## 2. South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) Porosity
**Observation:** A localized depression in Earth's magnetic field strength (approx. 30% weaker) situated over South America and the South Atlantic.
**PIOSA Validation:** The SAA acts as a **Structural Manifold**. The 45-km hull in this sector exhibits lower magnetic/density shielding, allowing for the observation of internal luminescence (as reported in regional mesa fissures) and higher radiation flux from the internal plasma cavity.



## 3. The Mohorovičić Discontinuity (Moho) as an Inner Surface
**Observation:** A global seismic boundary occurring at an average depth of 35–45 km where p-wave velocity increases sharply.
**PIOSA Validation:** Within this model, the Moho is not merely a chemical change in rock but the **Physical Inner Boundary** of the planetary hull. This thickness is the primary variable in the `inertia_audit.py` script.



## 4. Hydraulic Buffer (Oil) and Seismic Dampening
**Observation:** Correlation between high-volume petroleum extraction and increased localized seismic "brittleness" or micro-tremors in non-tectonic zones.
**PIOSA Validation:** Petroleum acts as a **Hydraulic Lubricant** between the 45-km shell layers. Depleting this buffer reduces the shell's ability to absorb rotational torsion, leading to structural "nervousness" and seismic chatter.
