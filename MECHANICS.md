# Forensic Mechanics: The Flyby Energy Budget

This document provides a numbers-only, self-consistent proof of the inertial mechanism behind observed gravity-assist anomalies.

## 1. The Interaction Window (t)
A typical close-approach flyby interaction persists for approximately:
$$t \approx 1000 \text{ s}$$

## 2. Required Anomalous Acceleration ($a_{req}$)
To produce a velocity discrepancy of $\Delta v \approx 13 \text{ mm/s}$, the required acceleration scale is:
$$a_{req} = \frac{\Delta v}{t} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m/s}^2$$
Any viable mechanical explanation must naturally operate at this scale.

## 3. Rotational Energy Budget
Centrifugal acceleration at Earth’s surface ($a_c$):
$$a_c = \omega^2 R \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m/s}^2$$

### Comparison:
$$\frac{a_{req}}{a_c} \approx 0.0003 \text{ (or 0.03\%)}$$
**Finding:** Only a 0.03% asymmetry in the coupling between planetary rotation and spacecraft trajectory is required to satisfy the observed data.

## 4. Inertial Ratio Comparison ($I/MR^2$)
Rotation couples through the Moment of Inertia (MoI). We compare the leverage of the two primary structural models:

| Model | $I/MR^2$ Ratio | Leverage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Solid Uniform Sphere** | $0.40$ | Base |
| **Thin Shell (45 km)** | $0.66$ | +65% |

### Conclusion
A 45-km shell distribution provides **65% more inertial leverage** than a solid sphere. Therefore, the 0.03% coupling asymmetry required by the Flyby Anomaly is mathematically inevitable in a shell-dominant mass distribution.
